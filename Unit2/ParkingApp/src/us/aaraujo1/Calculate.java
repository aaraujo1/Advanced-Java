 * The fee charged for parked vehicles is based on a $5.00 minimum fee to park for up to three hours.
 * After that there is an additional $1.00 per hour charge for each hour or part of an hour parked.
 * The maximum charge for any given 24-hour period is $15.00.
 * Assume that no vehicle parks for longer than 24 hours.Â
