About Version 7
------------------
The key difference in this version is that we make the program a bit
more realistic by using a GUI to change fly and quack behaviors at runtime.
Changing behavior at runtime is one of the most powerful things you can do
with the DIP/Strategy Pattern.

Please note: you are not expected to understand GUI development at this point.
However, by showing you how a GUI class can change fly and quack behaviors
based on user input, we provide this sample code. This would not be possible
without the DIP and Strategy Pattern.
